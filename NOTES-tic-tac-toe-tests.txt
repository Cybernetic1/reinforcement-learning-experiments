Fully-connected RL, Tic Tac Toe
===============================

Defined in gym-tictactoe/gym_tictactoe/tic_tac_toe1.py:

* action space = 3 x 3 = 9-dim vector

* state space = 3 x 3 = 9-dim vector with values from [-1,1], 0 = empty square
* n_features = 9

This is the "free" version, where the state vector is a 3 x 3 = 9-vector

Network topology = 9-inputs -9-7-5- 9-outputs

Total number of independent weights:


Symmetric NN + RL, Tic Tac Toe
==============================

Defined in gym-tictactoe/gym_tictactoe/tic_tac_toe2.py:

* action space = 3 x 3 = 9-dim vector

* state space = 3 x 3 = 9 propositions,
	each proposition = 3-dim vector (thus totally 27-dim vector)
	where each proposition = (player, row, column) taking values from [-1,1], [0,3], [0,3] respectively
* n_features = 27

Network topology:

* h-network:  3-inputs, -6-9- , 9-outputs
(each h-network is repeated 9 times)

* g-network:  9-inputs, -9-9- , 9-outputs

Total number of independent weights:
